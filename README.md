- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KalashKhator, a very enthusiastic and eager to learn 'kid' who finds joy in creating applications that are easy to use and great to look at, apps that have an intuitive UX and simplistic and responsive UI.
I have worked on multiple platforms and technologies and have experience with the agile processes and source controls like git. I am a very fast learner and have an analytical mind that helps me understand and solve problems faster.
